# ChatGenius - AI-Enhanced Chat Learning Project

ChatGenius is a 2-week sprint project focused on exploring AI-assisted development using Replit and Cursor agents. The goal was to build a Slack-like team communication platform while learning how to effectively integrate AI capabilities and modern development tools.

This project serves as a practical workshop for understanding how to rapidly prototype a full-stack application with AI assistance. While not intended for production use, it implements a comprehensive set of features to demonstrate the capabilities of AI-enhanced development workflows.
